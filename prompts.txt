Suggest alternative routes to reduce cost

Understanding the Results
These help you interpret what the optimizer did and why.
“Explain why the total cost is higher than expected.”
“Summarize the main bottlenecks in the supply chain network.”
“Which supplier–plant routes contribute the most to cost?”
“How balanced is the production across plants?”
“Describe the logic behind the chosen shipment routes.”

Optimization Improvements
These guide the AI to suggest what to tweak for better outcomes.
“Suggest three ways to reduce total transportation cost.”
“How can I improve supplier utilization efficiency?”
“What if I increase Plant P2’s capacity — how will that affect cost?”
“Propose alternative warehouse allocations to meet demand faster.”
“If we relax lead time constraints by one day, what improvements can occur?”

Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis
Ask for what-if analyses or sensitivities.
“Analyze the impact of increasing customer demand by 10%.”
“Which parameter (transport cost or plant cost) has the biggest effect on total cost?”
“If one supplier fails, what backup strategy would minimize disruption?”
“Simulate the scenario where transportation cost rises by 15%.”

Strategic Planning
Ask it for more strategic business insights or long-term planning help.
“Recommend an optimal warehouse location to add next year.”
“Identify which suppliers should be prioritized for long-term contracts.”
“What are the risks in the current logistics configuration?”
“Suggest a 3-step plan to minimize both cost and delivery time.”

Debugging or Data Sanity
You can even ask it to reason about data itself.
“Are there any inconsistencies or missing connections in the network?”
“Why might the model return infeasible results?”
“Check if demand is balanced properly with total supply.”
